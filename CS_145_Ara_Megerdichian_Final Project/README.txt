Stylized pages: index.html, menu.html, about_us.html

Other links are "unfinished", but have a page, so are necessary to submit.


Pages are intended to be viewed in full screen, but can be viewed in the perscribed 1000px size with minimal changes. 

Pages will scroll horizontally when window goes below 900px, but this is allowed according to the rubric.
